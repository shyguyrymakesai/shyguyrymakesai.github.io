Bum didda didda dum
Bum didda didda dum

as i transcribe the sounds I hear,
I notice we are lacking not in language,
but in facilities

For, it is simple to understand the sounds as they scream their truth
it is clear that they speak softly to our untrained being

but as i listen I find them saying the same things
just as I use the same words as above

bum didda didda dum
bum didda didda dum

and you call this unintelligble
but you lack the awareness of its structure, its glisten comes from internal reflection and refraction

Simple physics, timbre, pitch, yada yada yada

And yet not a one of us attempts to speak back and truly ask
What do you say to me Mr. Banjo?
