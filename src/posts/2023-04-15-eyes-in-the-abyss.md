I met the void where it lived
and somehow I also lived

So deep, so dark, so daunting.
Surely nothing could survive these depths
For not even light reaches our sentinel Marianas

But as I sat and stared and sunk deeper
I noticed the eyes

Those beady, bloody, alien eyes
They seemed to scream

And yet, I found no mouths
Only eyes
