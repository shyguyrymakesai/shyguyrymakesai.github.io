Out of Your Depth
by Ryan M.

I walked in heavy with echoesâ€”
a boy scattered across years
stitched with gold and contradiction.

You looked at me like data.
Like something to file.
Like I hadnâ€™t already bled for my own answers.

But if Iâ€™m a puzzle,
youâ€™re out of your depth, doctor.
Iâ€™m written in languages
youâ€™ve never had to live through.
