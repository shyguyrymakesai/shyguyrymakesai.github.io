Hey everyone — thanks for stopping by my new blog and website! I appreciate you checking it out and being interested in what I’m up to.

If you haven’t seen the main site yet, click back to Home (bottom left) and give it a look!

This post will typically serve as a place where I share my development progress, technical logs, and behind-the-scenes updates.

I'll be showing how I’m currently using AI in my workflow and how you might incorporate it into yours.

I haven’t finished writing the full dev log just yet, but I didn’t want to include any “dummy” blogs for launch — only real ones.

So check back soon — I’ll be updating this with an in-depth walkthrough of how I created this site and my WhatsApp-integrated AI assistant.
