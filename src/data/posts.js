And my heart will start to stir.  

How can I tell this stranger:

She quells the relentless storm in my mind,  
silences the harkening of doubt, depravity, and delirium.  

Brighter than the sun,  
she relegates the dark and cold to literary imagination.  
Her presence is radiance made form,  
and no diamond could match her shine,  
nor any sunset her colors.  

When she steps into my view, I see the future and its eventualities.  
I see unbounded adventure, purpose, and serenity.  
I see a life I cannot help but live.  

But that all sounds a bit obsessive and gushy...

So instead I say,  
**“Yes.”** ❤️

From earth, we’re sending shockwaves through the night,  
All in a vain attempt to end our human plight  

And we certainly haven’t got it right  
But still, in time, we’ll be alright  

Because no longer a single flicker in the dark  
We have created a second spark
