And my heart will start to stir.  

How can I tell this stranger:

She quells the relentless storm in my mind,  
silences the harkening of doubt, depravity, and delirium.  

Brighter than the sun,  
she relegates the dark and cold to literary imagination.  
Her presence is radiance made form,  
and no diamond could match her shine,  
nor any sunset her colors.  

When she steps into my view, I see the future and its eventualities.  
I see unbounded adventure, purpose, and serenity.  
I see a life I cannot help but live.  

But that all sounds a bit obsessive and gushy...

So instead I say,  
**“Yes.”** ❤️

From earth, we’re sending shockwaves through the night,  
All in a vain attempt to end our human plight  

And we certainly haven’t got it right  
But still, in time, we’ll be alright  

Because no longer a single flicker in the dark  
We have created a second spark

Hey everyone — thanks for stopping by my new blog and website! I appreciate you checking it out and being interested in what I’m up to.  

If you haven’t seen the main site yet, click back to Home (bottom left) and give it a look!  

This post will typically serve as a place where I share my development progress, technical logs, and behind-the-scenes updates.  

I'll be showing how I’m currently using AI in my workflow and how you might incorporate it into yours.  

I haven’t finished writing the full dev log just yet, but I didn’t want to include any “dummy” blogs for launch — only real ones.  

So check back soon — I’ll be updating this with an in-depth walkthrough of how I created this site and my WhatsApp-integrated AI assistant.

And so it begins
I become john green.

he helped me see
I have ocd

its a rather tricky variant
it hides in plain sight as unimportant

but my existence,
ah my existence,
it beckons me like the sirens call

why am i here at all?

(ryan has existential ocd. A somewhat rarer form of OCD)

Concussed and beaten red
I am already dead
They interrogate my corpse like it can help

But, if you want to escape the prison without me
You should've brought a map
 or stolen mine before I burned it

 For the only way out of a maze
 is to follow it one way
and you're cursed till end of days
 to never look back
 even when under attack

Even when arrows fly and your city cries
You cannot turn them to salt or stone
Eyes foward, solider
Head up.
Chin High.
Back Straight.

For anything

And now, I have everything
But in a deal with the devil

I killed him on the way up
And now all that remains is our fused being

Never to know perfection again I will drift forever towards its memory

Bum didda didda dum
Bum didda didda dum

as i transcribe the sounds I hear,
I notice we are lacking not in language,
but in facilities

For, it is simple to understand the sounds as they scream their truth
it is clear that they speak softly to our untrained being

but as i listen I find them saying the same things
just as I use the same words as above

bum didda didda dum
bum didda didda dum

and you call this unintelligble
but you lack the awareness of its structure, its glisten comes from internal reflection and refraction

Simple physics, timbre, pitch, yada yada yada

And yet not a one of us attempts to speak back and truly ask
What do you say to me Mr. Banjo?

I met the void where it lived
and somehow I also lived

So deep, so dark, so daunting.
Surely nothing could survive these depths
For not even light reaches our sentinel Marianas

But as I sat and stared and sunk deeper
I noticed the eyes

Those beaty, bloody, alien eyes
They seemed to scream

And yet, I found no mouths
Only eyes

they say the grass is always greener...
But, what if its actually pinker?

On the other side i mean.
What if the inhabitants across the vally see in UV?

Can i still love the grass?
Can I fall in love with cotton candy fields rather than sweeping green vistas?

I have no doubt
For I can fall in love with anything

I have loved myself and I have loved my hatred for myself
I have loved others and I have loved the one
I have loved and I have loved

And I will continue to do so until it is all that remains
I have been consumed before and this time I invite the feast

May the maggots feast on my flesh and from their larvae
may god allow for life to flourish once more
