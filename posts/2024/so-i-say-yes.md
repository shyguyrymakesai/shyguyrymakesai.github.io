Whenever people see us together, they will ask,
"Well, do you love her?"

And my heart will start to stir.

How can I tell this stranger:

She quells the relentless storm in my mind,
silences the harkening of doubt, depravity, and delirium.

Brighter than the sun,
she relegates the dark and cold to literary imagination.
Her presence is radiance made form,
and no diamond could match her shine,
nor any sunset her colors.

When she steps into my view, I see the future and its eventualities.
I see unbounded adventure, purpose, and serenity.
I see a life I cannot help but live.

But that all sounds a bit obsessive and gushy...

So instead I say,
**"Yes."** ❤️
