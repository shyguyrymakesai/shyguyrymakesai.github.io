Concussed and beaten red
I am already dead
They interrogate my corpse like it can help

But, if you want to escape the prison without me
You should've brought a map
 or stolen mine before I burned it

 For the only way out of a maze
 is to follow it one way
and you're cursed till end of days
 to never look back
 even when under attack

Even when arrows fly and your city cries
You cannot turn them to salt or stone
Eyes foward, solider
Head up.
Chin High.
Back Straight.
