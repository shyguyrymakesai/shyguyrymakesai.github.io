they say the grass is always greener...
But, what if its actually pinker?

On the other side i mean.
What if the inhabitants across the vally see in UV?

Can i still love the grass?
Can I fall in love with cotton candy fields rather than sweeping green vistas?

I have no doubt
For I can fall in love with anything

I have loved myself and I have loved my hatred for myself
I have loved others and I have loved the one
I have loved and I have loved

And I will continue to do so until it is all that remains
I have been consumed before and this time I invite the feast

May the maggots feast on my flesh and from their larvae
may god allow for life to flourish once more
